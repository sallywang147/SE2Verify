Sure, when analyzing this code for potential verification proof failure points, it's important to consider the specific constraints set by the verification framework being used. Firstly, here's the given code again for reference:

```rust
use vstd::prelude::*;
verus! {
    fn octuple(x1: i8) -> i8 {
        let x2 = x1 + x1;
        let x4 = x2 + x2;
        x4 + x4
    }

    fn main() {
        let n = octuple(20);
    }
}
```

### Possible Verification Proof Failure Points

1. **Integer Overflow**:
   - **Potential Issue**: In the `octuple` function, integer overflow can occur when performing arithmetic operations.
   - **Reason**: The `i8` type can hold values ranging from -128 to 127. The input value 20, when multiplied by 8 (which is effectively what the function does), results in 160, which exceeds the maximum value i8 can represent.
   - **Fix**: One potential solution is to use a wider integer type such as `i16` or `i32` to avoid overflow, or introduce checks to make sure overflow doesnâ€™t happen.

### Verification Proof Checks and Fixes:
    
1. **Checking and Handling Integer Overflow**:

    ```rust
    use vstd::prelude::*;
    verus! {
        fn octuple(x1: i8) -> Option<i8> {
            let x2 = x1.checked_add(x1)?;
            let x4 = x2.checked_add(x2)?;
            x4.checked_add(x4)
        }
        
        fn main() {
            if let Some(n) = octuple(20) {
                // Do something with n
            } else {
                // Handle overflow case
            }
        }
    }
    ```
   - **Explanation**: The `checked_add` method will return `None` if an overflow occurs, safely preventing the undefined behavior. The function now returns an `Option<i8>`, which the caller must handle appropriately.


2. **Using a Wider Integer Type**:

    ```rust
    use vstd::prelude::*;
    verus! {
        fn octuple(x1: i16) -> i16 {
            let x2 = x1 + x1;
            let x4 = x2 + x2;
            x4 + x4
        }
        
        fn main() {
            let n = octuple(20);
        }
    }
    ```
   - **Explanation**: By changing the parameter and return types from `i8` to `i16`, the code can handle larger values without risk of overflow. The output will be the correct multiplication of the input by 8 within the bounds of `i16`.

### Summary
The primary verification proof failure point identified in this code is related to potential integer overflow when performing arithmetic operations on an `i8` type. By either adding overflow checks or using a wider integer type, the code can be made safe and reliable within the verification framework constraints.
