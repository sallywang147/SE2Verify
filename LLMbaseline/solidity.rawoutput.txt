Sure, let's break down the code and identify potential verification proof failure points, the reasons they might fail, and how to fix these issues.

### Code Review and Analysis

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Test {

    function test_precondition(uint256[] memory arr, uint256 x) pure public returns (uint256 y) {
        require(x >= 10);
        for (uint i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            require(arr[i] >= 10 && arr[i] <= 20);
        }

        y = x - 5;

        assert(y >= 5);  // passed
        for (uint i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            assert(arr[i] >= 10 && arr[i] <= 20);  
            assert(arr[i] + 1 >= 11 && arr[i] - 1 <= 19);  
            assert(arr[i]*arr[i] >= 100 && arr[i]*arr[i] <= 400);
        }
    }
}
```

### Potential Verification Proof Failure Points

1. **Loop Invariants**:
   - Loops are common sources of verification failure because proving properties over loops often requires specifying loop invariants. In this code, there are two loops: one in the preconditions (`require` statements) and one in the postconditions (`assert` statements).

2. **Boundaries and Conditions Inside Loops**:
   - The conditions inside the loops, especially those related to arithmetic operations (like `arr[i] + 1` and `arr[i]*arr[i]`), need careful handling to avoid overflow and underflow issues, even though modern Solidity versions have some overflow protection. The SMTChecker might still raise issues regarding the range and arithmetic conditions.

### Why These Points Cause Failures

1. **Loop Invariants**:
   - The Solidity SMTChecker often has trouble reasoning about array indices and their corresponding values across iterations without explicit loop invariants.
   - The loop invariant would need to assert the conditions that hold true before and after each iteration of the loop.

2. **Boundaries and Conditions Inside Loops**:
   - For example, `arr[i] + 1 >= 11` translates to `arr[i] >= 10`, which is satisfied by the `require` statements. However, `arr[i] - 1 <= 19` translates to `arr[i] <= 20`, which might be checked more rigorously by the SMTChecker.
   - The condition `arr[i]*arr[i] >= 100` translates to `arr[i] >= 10` and `arr[i]*arr[i] <= 400` translates to `arr[i] <= 20`. These, too, are implied by the `require` statements, but the arithmetic might cause the SMTChecker to look for explicit proof.

### Fixes for the Failures

#### Adding Loop Invariants:

To help the SMTChecker, we can add comments indicating loop invariants. SMTCheckers may utilize these comments to better understand the intended behavior of the code.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Test {

    function test_precondition(uint256[] memory arr, uint256 x) pure public returns (uint256 y) {
        require(x >= 10);
        // Loop invariant: every element in arr from 0 to i is between 10 and 20
        for (uint i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            require(arr[i] >= 10 && arr[i] <= 20);
        }

        y = x - 5;

        assert(y >= 5);  // passed
        // Loop invariant: every element in arr from 0 to i is between 10 and 20
        // and arr[i] + 1 is between 11 and 21
        // and arr[i] - 1 is between 9 and 19
        // and arr[i] * arr[i] is between 100 and 400
        for (uint i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            assert(arr[i] >= 10 && arr[i] <= 20);  
            assert(arr[i] + 1 >= 11 && arr[i] - 1 <= 19);  
            assert(arr[i]*arr[i] >= 100 && arr[i]*arr[i] <= 400);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Addressing Overflow and Underflow Issues:

Adopting the `CheckedArithmetic` approach (`assert` statements that ensure overflow/underflow conditions), even though modern Solidity versions have built-in checks, can help:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Test {

    function test_precondition(uint256[] memory arr, uint256 x) pure public returns (uint256 y) {
        require(x >= 10);
        for (uint i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            require(arr[i] >= 10 && arr[i] <= 20);
        }

        unchecked {
            y = x - 5;
        }

        assert(y >= 5);  // passed
        for (uint i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            assert(arr[i] >= 10 && arr[i] <= 20);  
            assert(arr[i] + 1 >= 11);
            assert(arr[i] - 1 <= 19);
            assert(arr[i]*arr[i] >= 100 && arr[i]*arr[i] <= 400);
        }
    }
}
```

Adding descriptive comments (loop invariants) helps in ensuring that the SMTChecker has enough context to verify the code. Additionally, using `unchecked` for arithmetic operations helps mitigate overflow-related issues, although this risks runtime errors when values are extreme.

By carefully stating conditions and adding invariants, the SMTChecker can verify the correctness of the code more effectively.
